Project 1: Personnel Management System

This directory contains the files neccesary
to run the Personnel Management System Lab Assignment.

This Program implements a binary search tree of employee names
that is constructed by reading names from a file. Once the tree
is constructed the user has the option to view the names of employees,
add a new employee to the tree, or remove an employee from the tree.

To compile the program:
   $ make

To run the Program:
   $./bstDemo

To delete binaries:
   $ make clean

Outside Help:
 I did use some outside resources besides the lab manual in order to help
 with the node deletion part of this project. These sources include youtube
 videos as well as online forums. Although I did not copy code from these places,
 I did use some of the ideas and logic in my implementations.
