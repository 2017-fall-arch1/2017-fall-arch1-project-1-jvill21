Project 1: Personnel Management System

This directory contains the files neccesary
to run the Personnel Management System Lab Assignment.

This Program implements a binary search tree of employee names
that is constructed by reading names from a file. Once the tree
is constructed the user has the option to view the names of employees,
add a new employee to the tree, or remove an employee from the tree.

To compile the program:
   $ make

To run the Program:
   $./bstDemo

To delete binaries:
   $ make clean

Outside Help:
 I did use some outside resources besides the lab manual in order to help
 with the node deletion part of this project. I looked at psuedocode from different 
 youtube videos as well as data structure lectures from other universities to help
 get a better understanding of how to remove a node from a binary search tree.
